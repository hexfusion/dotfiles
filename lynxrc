# Lynx User Defaults File

# This file contains options saved from the Lynx Options Screen (normally
# with the '>' key).  There is normally no need to edit this file manually,
# since the defaults here can be controlled from the Options Screen, and the
# next time options are saved from the Options Screen this file will be
# completely rewritten.  You have been warned...
# If you are looking for the general configuration file - it is normally
# called lynx.cfg, and it has different content and a different format.
# It is not this file.

# accept_all_cookies allows the user to tell Lynx to automatically
# accept all cookies if desired.  The default is "FALSE" which will
# prompt for each cookie.  Set accept_all_cookies to "TRUE" to accept
# all cookies.
accept_all_cookies=off

# bookmark_file specifies the name and location of the default bookmark
# file into which the user can paste links for easy access at a later
# date.
